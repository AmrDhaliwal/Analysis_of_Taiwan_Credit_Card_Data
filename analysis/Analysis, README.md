# Research Questions

## How is education correlated to spending and paying off credit cards?
For this research question I used a Scatterplot ![alt text](https://github.com/[AmrDhaliwal]/[course-project-solo_119]/blob/[main]/images/EDUCATION%vs%PAY_AMT_APR.png?raw=true) and a boxplot
![alt text](https://github.com/[AmrDhaliwal]/[course-project-solo_119]/blob/[main]/images/EDUCATION%vs%BILL_AMT_APR.png?raw=true). In the dataset used the Education
column was split into 4 sub-categories (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others). Unfortunatly the others category is very ambigous it seems to
contain primarily undecuated persons. When looking at the boxplot it's clear that the people in subcategory 1 have the highest debt out of the 4 subcategories.
The interesting thing about the data in all the plots is it seems that the sub-categories go in order of 4, 3, 2, and 1. The high debt for those that have attended graduate school and university 
are definatly partly attributed to paying for school fees. This is also true for the scatterplot for the Auguest bill payments  the debt seems to be 
similar across both scatterplots. Also when looking at the correlation between the two payment scatterplots those with higher debt are making higher repayments.
