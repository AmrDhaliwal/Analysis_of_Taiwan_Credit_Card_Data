## Milestones

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

My hope for this first Milestone project is to create useful visuals for the data set being used. The interest for this data mainly came from the fact that the data was collected in Taiwan back in 2005, which can be useful insight to see how spending habits have changed over a decade and a half. The main question I want to explore using this data set is how is education correlated to spending and paying off credit debt? Are educated people managing their debt better than less educated people and do they try to pay off their debt faster? The final question to be answered could a user-facing Dashboard be made with this data set and I believe that it defiantly can. Taiwan isnâ€™t the only country with credit cards or credit debt, and I think other countries and companies, and individuals would value using a Dashboard built off the default of credit card data set.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data set being used for this Milestone project 1, solo 119 is default of credit card clients. The data set was provided by the Department of Information Management, Chung Hua University, Taiwan and Department of Civil Engineering, Tamkang University, Taiwan. The data contains the information for 30000 instances of the default credit card payment for people in Taiwan. It has many variables which makes the data quite versatile, it has the persons age, education, and marital status also, contains past payment records, amount of bill statement and amount of previous payment. All the data in this set was collected from April to September 2005. The whole reason for the creation of this data set was too see the default payments of customers in Taiwan across six data mining methods. All the data was collected by the credit card companies that the customers were using in Taiwan so, they could create and compare predictive accuracy of probability across six data mining methods.
